### GitHub token

- For a site-wide token, add it to the `data-github-token` attribute on the `<script type="module" src="assets/js/app.js">` tag in `index.html` before deploying.
- Visitors can still override or add their own token locally using the controls in the GitHub panel; tokens are stored in their browser only.
